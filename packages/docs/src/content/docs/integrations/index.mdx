`gau` is designed to be framework-agnostic. It can run anywhere, but official support makes it easier.

It provides client-side components and hooks for frameworks. This section covers the common features and options available across all client integrations.

`gau` has support for full-stack frameworks:

<div class="row">
  <IconLink href="/integrations/sveltekit/" icon="i-material-icon-theme:svelte" title="SvelteKit" flat />
  <IconLink href="/integrations/solidstart/" icon="i-devicon:solidjs" title="SolidStart" flat />
</div> 

And backend-only frameworks:

<div class="row">
  <IconLink href="/integrations/bun-serve/" icon="i-logos:bun" title="Bun.serve" flat />
  <IconLink href="/integrations/elysia/" icon="i-icons:elysia" title="Elysia" flat />
</div> 

## AuthProvider

To get started, you need to wrap your application's root component with the `AuthProvider`. This component manages the authentication state and makes it available throughout your app.

### Props

You can configure the `AuthProvider` with the following props:

#### `baseUrl`

> **Type**: `string`
> **Default**: `'/api/auth'`

The base URL for the authentication API endpoints. This should match the `basePath` configured in your `createAuth` setup on the server.

<Aside type="note">
  If your frontend and backend are on different hosts, you'll need to set this to the full URL of your backend's auth API.
</Aside>

#### `scheme`

> **Type**: `string`
> **Default**: `'gau'`

The URL scheme used for deep linking in desktop applications (e.g., Tauri). This is used to redirect the user back to your app after they have authenticated with an OAuth provider.

#### `redirectTo`

> **Type**: `string`
> **Default**: The current host URL

A default URL to redirect to after a successful sign-in. This can be overridden by passing a `redirectTo` option to the `signIn` function.

## useAuth

The `useAuth` hook is the primary way to access authentication state and methods in your components.

### Return Values

The `useAuth` hook returns an object with the following properties:

#### `session`

> **Type**: `GauSession`

An object containing the current authentication state. Its `user` and `session` properties will be `null` if the user is not authenticated.

- `user`: The user object from the database, or `null`.
- `session`: The session object containing the raw JWT payload, or `null`.
- `accounts`: An array of OAuth accounts linked to the user, or `null`.
- `providers`: An array of available provider IDs.

#### `signIn`

> **Type**: `(provider: string, options?: { redirectTo?: string }) => Promise<void>`

A function to initiate the sign-in process with a specific OAuth provider.

- `provider`: The ID of the provider to use (e.g., `'github'`, `'google'`).
- `options.redirectTo`: A URL to redirect to after a successful sign-in, overriding the default `redirectTo` prop on the `AuthProvider`.

<Aside type="note">
  You can get full TypeScript support for your provider IDs by creating a typed `useAuth` hook. See the framework integration guides for examples.
</Aside>

#### `signOut`

> **Type**: `() => Promise<void>`

A function to sign the user out, clearing their session.

#### `linkAccount`

> **Type**: `(provider: string, options?: { redirectTo?: string }) => Promise<void>`

A function to initiate the OAuth flow to manually link an additional provider to the currently authenticated user's account.

- `provider`: The ID of the provider to link (e.g., `'github'`, `'google'`).
- `options.redirectTo`: A URL to redirect to after a successful link, overriding the default `redirectTo` prop on the `AuthProvider`.

#### `unlinkAccount`

> **Type**: `(provider: string) => Promise<void>`

A function to unlink an OAuth provider from the user's account.

- `provider`: The ID of the provider to unlink.

<Aside type="caution">
  A user cannot unlink their last remaining account, as this would leave them with no way to sign in. `gau` will prevent this action and return an error.
