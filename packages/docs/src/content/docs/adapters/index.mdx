description: How to use database adapters with gau.

import IconLink from '~/components/IconLink.astro';

`gau` can work with any database, though currently no databases are supported directly.

It's adviced to use an ORM, which abstracts the database away.
`gau` currently only supports Drizzle and the SQLite driver.

<div class="row">
  <IconLink href="/adapters/drizzle/" icon="i-icons:drizzle" title="Drizzle" />
</div>
