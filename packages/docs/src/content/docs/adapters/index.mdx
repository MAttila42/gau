import IconLink from 'starlight-plugin-icons/components/IconLink.astro'

`gau` can work with any database, though currently no databases are supported directly.

It's adviced to use an ORM, which abstracts the database away. `gau` currently only supports Drizzle and the SQLite driver.

<div class="row">
  <IconLink href="/adapters/drizzle/" icon="i-icons:drizzle" title="Drizzle" flat />
</div> 

The `createAuth` function not only sets up your authentication logic but also returns a set of database methods from your adapter, allowing you to interact with your user data directly.

## Database Methods

Here are the methods returned by `createAuth`, which you can use in your application's server-side logic:

### `getUser`

> **Type**: `(id: string) => Promise<User | null>`

Retrieves a user by their unique ID.

### `getUserByEmail`

> **Type**: `(email: string) => Promise<User | null>`

Finds a user by their email address.

### `getUserByAccount`

> **Type**: `(provider: string, providerAccountId: string) => Promise<User | null>`

Fetches a user based on their linked OAuth account.

### `getAccounts`

> **Type**: `(userId: string) => Promise<Account[]>`

Retrieves all accounts linked to a user.

### `getUserAndAccounts`

> **Type**: `(userId: string) => Promise<{ user: User, accounts: Account[] } | null>`

Retrieves a user and all their linked accounts in a single call.

### `createUser`

> **Type**: `(data: NewUser) => Promise<User>`

Creates a new user in the database.

### `linkAccount`

> **Type**: `(data: NewAccount) => Promise<void>`

Links an OAuth account to an existing user.

### `unlinkAccount`

> **Type**: `(provider: string, providerAccountId: string) => Promise<void>`

### `updateUser`
